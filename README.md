## Evaluating Shortcut Utilization in Deep Learning Disease Classification through Counterfactual Analysis

We propose a novel approach to evaluate \textit{real-world} datasets and determine the extent to which each protected attribute is used as a shortcut in a classification task. Therefore, we define and train a causal generative model to produce causally-grounded counterfactuals, removing protected attributes from activations and allowing us to measure their impact on model performance.
